This is a guide to help you prepare your digital life before your visit to Hainan. This info also applies to China in general.

All of China except Hong Kong has restricted internet access, so many western apps dont work in China. 
For example the following apps wont work:
- Google services such as search, app store, Gmail, and maps.
- WhatsApp
- Facebook
- Uber

Google Search, Chrome and Gmail dont work in China but Microsoft Bing, Edge, and Outlook email do. So consider a Outlook email account for communication in case you only have restricted internet access.

China has a different ecosystem of apps (Alipay, Wechat, Amap etc). You should prepare these apps before getting to Hainan/China.

Bank cards are not widely accepted outside of 5 star hotels. Use Alipay or Wechat instead. Use cash if you cant setup these apps.

Most people including taxi drivers will not speak English, so it is best to use online taxi apps (Alipay/Wechat mini apps) and have a translation app.


## Alipay and WeChat
Get Alipay and WeChat set up before you come to China. You can link your bank card to them and use them to make payments. China is largely cashless, everyone uses Wechat or Alipay to pay for things using a QR code. It is generally possible to still use cash but vendors may not have change. Using Wechat or Alipay will be much more convenient for you. 

Alipay and Wechat are "super apps" and have many mini-apps embedded within them. This is good because you dont have to download and create accounts for many different seperate apps.
For example:
- You can book online taxis within Alipay (using DiDi or Amap Taxi mini apps).
- You can rent public shared bicycles (HelloRide in Alipay).
- Order take out (Ele.me in Alipay).
- Translate Chinese <-> English (Search for "translate" in Alipay).
- Alipay has a built in screen translator.
- Book train tickets (search for 12306 in Alipay).
- Pay for local buses.

Note: Some mini apps may require a local phone number.

Alipay has an international version and is generally more foreigner friendly than Wechat for payments. But Wechat is the main app for communication. Wechat is very useful to have so you can communicate with your hotel or local people you may meet. Wechat can translate chat conversations.


## Mobile Data
eSIM - set up an eSim data package on your phone before you get to China and you can get unrestricted internet access with your eSim data. Otherwise you can register a local phone number with data but you will not be able to use the blocked western apps like Google, Whatsapp etc. Some VPNs will also allow you to get unrestricted internet access.


## Booking Hotel and tickets
Trip.com app is good for booking hotels, attractions, train tickets and flights.
It has a larger selection of accommodations than booking. When you book a hotel check the details that the hotel accepts foreigners because some hotels still have trouble accepting foreigners.

You can also book train tickets on the official government train ticket website:

## Maps
Amap is the best Chinese map on android. It can be opened from within Trip.com. Use with a screen translator to learn how it works. Amap is good for local bus/metro in big cities (Think of it as the google maps for China). Apple maps generally works within China.

Before you arrive in China you can download offline google maps (or Open Street Maps) of places you will visit. You can then use your phones GPS with your offline maps even if you have no mobile data/internet connection. You can use the offline maps for basic navigation.
